<h1>Printing</h1>
<p>In computer programs, "printing" generally means displaying text on the console (the output window)-- not physically printing onto paper. There are two principal methods used for printing:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span class = 'mono'> System.out.println()</span> prints whatever is enclosed in the (), then moves to the next line (so if you then print something else subsequently, it will appear on the line below).</li>
<li><span class = 'mono'>System.out.print() </span>prints whatever is in the () and stays on the same line. Output from the next print() or println() statement will begin on that same line.
  <pre class = 'cx'>

<code>System.out.print("Hello, World!"); </code>
<code>System.out.println(" It is I!"); //note the space at the beginning</code>
<code>System.out.println("I am on a new line.");</code>
<code>System.out.println(); //prints a blank line with no text</code>
<code>System.out.println("Goodbye");</code>
</pre>
  <div class='tip'>Note that the code above is not a complete class.  When providing examples, I will typically show only the part of the code that demonstrates a particular concept. </div>
  <p>will output:</p>
  <div class = 'console'>
<p>Hello, World! It is I! </p>
<p>I am on a new line. </p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>Goodbye</p>
  </div>

<p></p>
<p>You might be wondering what <span class='mono'>System.out </span>refers to. <span class='mono'>System </span>is a class in Java that is already written. You will see that we often use code from pre-existing classes, such as <span class='mono'>System</span>, so we do not need to write everything ourselves from scratch.</p>
<p>The examples above involve printing text to the console. In programming, text is called a <em>string</em> (think of a string of characters). A string can contain any number of characters.</p>
<h1>Formatted Printing</h1>
<h2>Escape Sequences</h2>
<p><em>Escape</em> <em>sequences</em> are groups or characters that allow you to format output within a string. They begin with a backslash character.</p>
<ul>
<li >\n inserts a new line</li>
<li >\" creates a double quote (") symbol <em>within</em> a string (and \' creates a single quote)</li>
<li >\\ creates a backslash (note the need for the second backslash to indicate that an actual backslash character is desired)</li>
<li >\t creates a tab</li>
</ul>

<p>For example,</p>

<!--p class = 'mono'>System.out.println("This\nis how \"escape sequences\" work");</p>-->
<pre class = 'cx'> System.out.println("This\nis how \"escape sequences\" work");</pre>
<p>produces</p>
<div class = 'console'>
<p>This</p>
<p>is how "escape sequences" work</p>
</div>
<p>because the \n moves to a new line and the \" creates a double quote (note that if the " were written without the backslash, it would end the string prematurely).</p>
<h2>The printf method</h2>
<p>You will often want to format double values so that they round to a certain number of places. For that, you can use the <span class='mono'>printf </span>method of <span class='mono'>System.out</span>, as follows. Note that you first define the format as a string inside " ", then write a comma, then the value(s) to be printed (separated by commas for multiple values). The % symbol in this context indicates a placeholder, i.e., that a value is to be printed. For <span class='mono'>%f</span>, The number following the decimal point indicates the number of decimal places to round to, and the <span class='mono'>f</span> indicates a float (i.e., a number with a decimal point)</p>
<pre class = 'cx'>

<code>System.out.printf("%.2f", 42.34626); //2 is the number of decimal places </code>
<code>System.out.println(); //needed to go to the next line of the console </code>
<code>//You can combine fixed text (e.g. "Pi is about") with format specifiers, like so</code>
<code>System.out.printf("Pi is about: %.3f", 3.1415926);</code>
</pre>
<p>outputs</p>
<div class ='console'>
<p>42.35</p>
<p>Pi is about: 3.142</p>
</div>

<p><span class='mono'>printf</span> can also specify integers (by using %d) and Strings (using %s). A new line is created with %n, rather than the \n escape sequence that print and println use.  Also notice in the example the use of more than one placeholder in the format string.</p>
<pre class='cx'>
<code>//using other format specifiers</code>
<code>System.out.printf("Her name is %s%n and her number is %d", "Kiera",35);</code>
</pre>
<p>outputs</p>
<div class='console'>
<p>Her name is Kiera</p>
<p>and her number is 35</p>
</div>
