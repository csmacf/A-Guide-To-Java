<h1>Printing</h1>
In computer programs,  “printing” means displaying on the console (the output window)-- not physically printing text onto paper.  There are two principal methods used for printing:

System.out.println() prints whatever is enclosed in the (), then moves to the next line (so if you then print something else subsequently, it will appear on the line below).
System.out.print() prints whatever is in the () and stays on the same line.  Output from the next print() or println() statement will begin on that same line.

System.out.print("Hello, World!");
System.out.println(" It's me!"); //note the space at the beginning
System.out.println("I'm on a new line.");
System.out.println(); //prints a blank line with no text
System.out.println("Goodbye");

will output:

Hello, World! It's me!
I'm on a new line.

Goodbye

Note that It's me prints on the same line as Hello, World! because of the use of print, rather than println, whereas Goodbye is printed on the line below It's me!

You might be wondering what System.out refers to. System is a class in Java that is already written.  You will see that we often use code from pre-written classes, such as System, so we do not need to write everything ourselves from scratch.

The examples above involve printing text to the console. In programming, text is called a string (think of a string of characters, as on a bracelet.  A string can contain any number of characters).
